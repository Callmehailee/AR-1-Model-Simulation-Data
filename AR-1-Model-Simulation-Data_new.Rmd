```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Try different values for standard deviation and different values for phi

```{r}

sd<-c(2:20)
sd

phi <- c(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9)

phi

```


#Just the data:
```{r}

simul_fun <- function(sigma, phi, length){
  
  ar1 <- arima.sim(n = length, list(ar = c(phi)), sd = sigma)
  return(ar1)

}

```

Get simulation data based on each of the standard deviation and each of the phi

```{r}

sd<-c(2:10)


phi <- c(0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.7,0.8,0.9)
data_list <- list() #empty data

for(val in sd){
  for(val2 in phi){
    data = as.data.frame(simul_fun(val, val2, 5))
  }
    for (i in 1:length(sd)){
    data_list[i] <- data
  }

}
#list_df = lapply(ls(), get)

#ls()

```
